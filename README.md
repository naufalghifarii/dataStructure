# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures using the C programming language. The data structures included are:

- **Linked List**: A dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements.
- **Hash Table**: An associative array data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
- **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand C implementations of common data structures.
- Modular design for each data structure, facilitating easy understanding and modification.
- Interactive command-line interface for user interaction with the implemented data structures.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable to interact with the implemented data structures.
4. Follow the prompts to perform various operations such as insertion, deletion, and display.
